# PORTFOLIO WITH SQLALCHEMY

This is the final project in the Team Treehouse Python Techdegree. It's using Python, a virtual environment, SQLAlchemy & Flask.

## INSTRUCTION
- download the project files
- create your virtual environment `python3 -m venv env`
- activate your virtual environment `source ./env/bin/activate` (mac)
- install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run app.py

## WHAT I LEARNED
I learned a lot from this Techdegree and this course specifically. Creating a back-end for a website is pretty straight-forward with these tools.
